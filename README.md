# FL_coastalflooding_report
This is a report on future flood risk for 19 coastal Florida cities. The study was conducted from 2020-2021 and funded by the Miami Herald. This report highlights the importance of user-friendly and high-impact flooding thresholds for various scenarios and the corresponding impacts.

## Summary
\textit{When will a particular coastal city have a 70% chance of at least one hour of flooding once a week? At least six hours of flooding once a week?} 
These questions underline the following project to assess the future of flooding in coastal Florida cities with user-friendly impact thresholds.

The main takeaways and an extended Executive Summary are included in the report. 

## Data
Data used for this project are hourly values of feet above Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) from https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/.
Projections of sea level rise have been produced by NOAA under multiple scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions and are documented in Sweet et al. (2017). Each tide gauge location has a flooding threshold (in feet above MHHW) and sea level rise projections for each decade out to 2060 specific to its location. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data derived from LiDAR elevation data are used for the topographic maps taken from
